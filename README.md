# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
<p>Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game! This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using C++. Two players take turns to mark the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid, and the player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.</p>

<h2>Game Rules</h2>
<p>1) The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
2) Player 1 is 'X' and Player 2 is 'O'. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
3) The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
4) When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.</p>

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>1) Player 1 (X) starts the game and is prompted to enter a number corresponding to the grid position where they want to place their mark.
2) Player 2 (O) then takes their turn and enters a number for their desired grid position.
3) The game continues until one player wins or all positions are filled.</p>
